Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline - 1960s
2. Advent of structured programming - 1970s
3. Rise of agile methodologies - 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: gathering and documenting of user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: creation of high level and detailed designs of the system arhitecture and user interfaces.
3. Implementation: writing of code and building the software system as per the design specifications.
4. Testing: carrying out of tests to ensure the software system meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: releasing of the software to users.
6. Maintenance: providing ongoing support, implementing updates and enhancing the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- the waterfall methodology uses a sequential approach with distinct phases e.g design, implementaion etc to develop a software while agile methodologies uses iterative and incremental approach to develop softwares, these methodologies focus on flexibility, collaboration and adaptability to change.
- the waterfall methodology would be apppropriate for large projects with well defined requirements that require minimal to no change at all while agile methodologies would be appropriate projects needing flexibility and adaptability.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software developer: they are responsible for writing code to turn the designs into functional software solutions.
2. Quality assurance engineer: they design and execute test plans to ensure software quality.
3. Project manager: oversees the whole software development life cycle from planning, execution and delivery of software solutions.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code, e.g Visual Studio.
2. Version Control Systems (VCS): VCSs enables tracking of changes to source code and coordination of work among team members, e.g Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing requirements
   i. Adopting agile methodologies to deliver work in small increments and adapt quickly.
   ii. Prioritizing critical requirements.
   iii. Clear communication with stakeholders to clarify evolving needs.
2. Tight deadlines
   i. Using agile sprints which breaks the project into smaller achievable milestones to track progress effectively.
   ii. Prioritizing tasks to focus on core functionalities first.
   iii. automating tasks where possible.
3. Technical debt
   i. Refactoring code regularly to catch areas of improvements early enough.
   ii. Following coding standards and best practices to maintain quality.
   iii. Writing tests to catch issues and bugs early enough.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing: this is the testing of individual components of a software.
   - this testing ensures early bug detection andd ensures code reliability by ensuring each component behaves correctly
2. Integration testing: it tests the interactions between different components of a software
   - it ensures smooth communication between components and catches interface issues early enough.
3. System testing: it tests the whole software system as a whole.
   - it validates full functionality by ensuring the system works end to end as intended
4. Acceptance testing: it tests the software system against user requirements to see whether it meets user needs.
   - it ensures the system solves the intended problem for users and ensures user satisfaction.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Definition: Prompt engineering is the crafting of questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
- Importance: Prompt engineering helps in avoiding vague prompts and answers by making sure prompts are clear and specific ensuring AI models understand exactly what you need.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Vague prompt: "Tell me about technology"
- Improvement: "Explain arificial intelligence as a field in technology and explain how it is transforming software engineering"
- the improved prompt is more effective as it is clear and focuses on a specific topic, artificial intelligence and it's effects in software engineering.
